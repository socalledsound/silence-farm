# silence farm

This is going to be a project that I've been wanting to build that let's people record their environment and upload it, then plays back a composite of all of the uploaded environments. I may also get a location and description of the sound.

I put it up here in this form just to demo how to upload and play sounds via firebase; next step is to display the waveforms in an interesting way.
